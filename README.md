# pet-hub
## about 
* In this project, we create a website called Pet-Hub, which has a main purpose of helping its users look for other pet-friends. The users will first land on a login page, where they input their username and password to log into the page, and also a "sign-up" option where users can sign up for the website. The users will then land on the neighbourhood page, where users can check their own pet's profile, and also all their neighbours who are interested in meeting their pets. When the users select the "Interested?" button in one of the pet's card, the "matches" page will be deployed, and the users get to see other pets around their neighbourhood. If they are interested in meeting or chatting with the other pet-owner, there is a chat option on the bottom of each cards and it will lead the users to their email accounts where they can directly contact other pet-owners via email. 

## neighbourhood
* In the neighbourhood page, the users are able to see the "Pet-Hub" title on top, 4 cards in the main section of the page, each card has the picture of the pet on the top half, the informations about the pet such as its name, age, size, breed, and a few others which are located in the second half of the card, and also an "Interested" button which would lead the users to the "matches" page.

## matches
* When the user is interested with another pet after reading their bio, they have the option to communicate with the other pet-owner via email. The "Click here to chat with the owner" link leads the user to their own email, and they can send a message to the other pet-owner.
